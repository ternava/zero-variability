# An Attempt to Define Null Variability

Submitted to VaMoS 2023 (#17).

### Summary

In this paper, we try to define the concept of **null-variability**, i.e. if, when and how variability can be removed or resolved from software systems. 


### Organisation

Code is available in the **scripts** directory, figures and supplementary images in the **figures** directory, a set of hello world programs in the hello wolrd directory and the raw data in the **measures** directory


### Focus on the true functionality

- The built-in `true.c`: https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/true.c
- The evolution of the built-in `true.c` : https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commits/master/src/true.c
- The `true.c` in toys: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/landley/toybox/master/toys/posix/true.c
